    "The CAO website publishes third level entry points data dating back to 1998 on its [website](http://www.cao.ie). The data is not particularly accessible, using a number of different file formats and with formatting and coding inconsistencies within those formats from year to year. The most recent data, 2021, is released as preformatted, whitespace-separated, columnar text embedded in a html page. The data relating to the years 2001 - 2004 follow the same pattern. The 2020 data is supplied in the form of an excel spreadsheet. The data for the years 2005 and 2008 - 2019 are released as pdf files containing a single table which is read straight down from one page to the next, while the 2006 and 2007 data are also supplied in a pdf file but with a more complex multi-column structure. Finally, the 1998 - 2000 data takes the form of scanned pdf files. It is intended here to extract the data from all but the scanned (1998-2000) data sources, clean and homogenise it, and place it all in a single pandas DataFrame for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes of interest for comparison between the various years' datasets are `Course Code`, `Course Name`, `Institution Name`, `EOS` (*End of Season*), which is the number of points achieved by the last applicant to be offered a place on the course, and `Mid`, which is the median of the scores of all applicants offered a place on the course. The level (whether or not the course is level 8), and a few edge-case indicators are also recorded as boolean attributes. These indicators are `Test`, indicating whether entry to the course is dependent on success in special test, portfolio, or interview process, `Not All`, indicating that not every applicant at the `EOS` points level was awarded a place, `AQA`, or *All Qualified Applicants*, meaning that all applicants with the minimum points were offered a place, and `New Comp`, which seems to indicate a course for which the points have increased in round 2."

Next, each file must be loaded and parsed, and the desired data extracted and cleaned.

Each of these types requires a different approach and so are dealt with separately below. Many of the individual data files have quirks which are dealt with mainly by paramaterising them in the parsing function for that particular file type.

Because this requires a curly brace, curly braces which surround quantifiers in the regular expression must be escaped by doubling them [2]. `{name_len}` is itself a quantifier, hence the triple curly brace - two for the quantifier and one for the f-string interpolation. The regex has four capture groups (delimited by parentheses) each separated by one or more whitespace characters. The capture groups are as follows: \n",

However, after the data of interest has been extracted, some manipulation of the DataFrame is necessary to clean the numeric columns and code any extra information. This process is the same for the 2020 data as it is for all the CAO data extracted from PDFs.

The `EOS` column is scanned for special characters and five new columns are generated for special qualifying indicators. Note that although a column for `Matric` is created, it is discarded at the end of the function because it occurs only rarely over the years and is not considered useful. It remains in the function so that the decision to omit it can be easily reversed, if necessary, in the future.\n",

These parameter values were obtained through examination of the original source PDF file and through trial-and-error. The columns are renamed to the standard names used in this project, erroneous and extraneous data is removed, and the columns are tidied up. Courses with non-standard structures such as two-subject-moderatorships - which are really two courses combined and have point ranges rather than point values - are removed.

    "### Data held in a multiple-column-per-page and multiple-page-per-column table in a PDF file\n",
    "#### 2007 and 2006\n",
    "\n",
    "The multicolumn PDF files containing the 2006 and 2007 CAO points data are particularly troublesome. They consist of a single table that runs across two (2006) or three (2007) page columns. However, on most pages at least one of the columns runs over the end of the page by an arbitrary number of rows. In order to maintain the correct sequence of rows these must be 'pushed up' onto the previous page. This is demonstrated in the images below. The first is of the first page of the 2007, level 8 file and the second is the first few rows of the second page of the same file. The order of the rows in the table is shown by the overlaid arrows. On the second image, the top two rows, outlined in red, really belong to the previous page if the intended row order is to be maintained.\n",

    "\n",
    "These difficulties are overcome by treating each table column as a separate table. `Tabula-py` allows the user to specify the region of interest on the page using its `read_pdf()`'s `area` parameter [5]. This parameter takes a list of floats representing the location on the page of the area of interest. These values were obtained by opening the pdf in the Inkscape vector illustration package [6], drawing a rectangle over each column, and noting the location and dimension values, as illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Getting column locations in Inkscape](images/inkscape_screenshot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing the column location and dimension values to the `read_cao_multicol()` function enables the extraction of each column into a separate DataFrame. In order to deal with the rows that run over onto the next page, a list containing the number of runover rows for each page is passed to the function via the `runover` parameter. These values are obtained by inspecting the original PDFs. These values are used to remove the correct number of rows from the beginning of the DataFrames that they don't belong to and add them to the ends of DataFrames they do belong to. Once this process is complete, the DataFrames are reordered and merged to form one complete table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a single DataFrame is obtained, a series of small manipulations clean up the data, finishing with the usual `tidy_cols()` call and the DataFrame is returned."

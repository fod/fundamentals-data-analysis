    "The CAO website publishes third level entry points data dating back to 1998 on its [website](http://www.cao.ie). The data is not particularly accessible, using a number of different file formats and with formatting and coding inconsistencies within those formats from year to year. The most recent data, 2021, is released as preformatted, whitespace-separated, columnar text embedded in a html page. The data relating to the years 2001 - 2004 follow the same pattern. The 2020 data is supplied in the form of an excel spreadsheet. The data for the years 2005 and 2008 - 2019 are released as pdf files containing a single table which is read straight down from one page to the next, while the 2006 and 2007 data are also supplied in a pdf file but with a more complex multi-column structure. Finally, the 1998 - 2000 data takes the form of scanned pdf files. It is intended here to extract the data from all but the scanned (1998-2000) data sources, clean and homogenise it, and place it all in a single pandas DataFrame for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes of interest for comparison between the various years' datasets are `Course Code`, `Course Name`, `Institution Name`, `EOS` (*End of Season*), which is the number of points achieved by the last applicant to be offered a place on the course, and `Mid`, which is the median of the scores of all applicants offered a place on the course. The level (whether or not the course is level 8), and a few edge-case indicators are also recorded as boolean attributes. These indicators are `Test`, indicating whether entry to the course is dependent on success in special test, portfolio, or interview process, `Not All`, indicating that not every applicant at the `EOS` points level was awarded a place, `AQA`, or *All Qualified Applicants*, meaning that all applicants with the minimum points were offered a place, and `New Comp`, which seems to indicate a course for which the points have increased in round 2."

Next, each file must be loaded and parsed, and the desired data extracted and cleaned.

Each of these types requires a different approach and so are dealt with separately below. Many of the individual data files have quirks which are dealt with mainly by paramaterising them in the parsing function for that particular file type.

Because this requires a curly brace, curly braces which surround quantifiers in the regular expression must be escaped by doubling them [2]. `{name_len}` is itself a quantifier, hence the triple curly brace - two for the quantifier and one for the f-string interpolation. The regex has four capture groups (delimited by parentheses) each separated by one or more whitespace characters. The capture groups are as follows: \n",

    "- `\\s+(\\S+)?\\s+(\\S+)?`. The final pair of capture groups are identical. Each one matches one or more non-whitespace characters following one or more whitespace characters. They are both optional to the match.

    "Of all the CAO source data, the 2020 Excel file is the most straightforward to extract to a pandas DataFrame. Pandas' `read_excel()` method is flexible and easy to use. However, after the data of interest has been extracted, some manipulation of the DataFrame is necessary to clean the numeric columns and code any extra information. This process is the same for the 2020 data as it is for all the CAO data extracted from PDFs. The `tidy_cols()` function defined below is therefore used for the final cleanup by not just the Excel data parser but by all of the remaining parsing functions in this notebook.\n",

    "The function takes a DataFrame into which the data for has been extracted from a source CAO data file. The `EOS` column is scanned for special characters and five new columns are generated for special qualifying indicators. Note that although a column for `Matric` is created, it is discarded at the end of the function because it occurs only rarely over the years and is not considered useful. It remains in the function so that the decision to omit it can be easily reversed, if necessary, in the future.\n",

The index is then reset and the columns reordered before the dataframe is returned."

Column errors are dealt with using values passed as parameters to the `read_cao_pdf()` function. These parameter values were obtained through examination of the original source PDF file and through trial-and-error. The columns are renamed to the standard names used in this project, erroneous and extraneous data is removed, and the columns are tidied up. Courses with non-standard structures such as two-subject-moderatorships - which are really two courses combined and have point ranges rather than point values - are removed.

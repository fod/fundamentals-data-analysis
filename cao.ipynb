    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAO points data, available from the [CAO website](http://www.cao.ie), is published in a different format for each of the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Each year's data, therefore, requires a different approach to acquisition, conversion to pandas DataFrame, and cleaning. The 2019 data is published in two PDF files; one for level 8 courses, and one for levels 6 and 7. The 2020 data is published as an Excel spreadsheet, and the 2021 data as preformatted text in a HTML web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes of interest for comparison between the various years' datasets are `Course Code`, `Course Name`, `Institution Name`, `EOS`, which is the number of points achieved by the last applicant to be offered a place on the course, and `Mid`, which is the mid point between the number of points held by the highest point score and the lowest point score of the applicants offered a place on the course [1]. The 2021 data does not explicitly contain an either an `EOS` or a `Mid` column. It does provide the *Round 1* and *Round 2* points required for entry into each course as `RND1` and `RND2`. Examination of the 2020 data, which contains both an `EOS` field *and* `RND1` and `RND2` fields demonstrates that the `EOS` field is equal to the `RND2` value if it exists, otherwise the `RND1` value (```EOS = RND1 if RND1 else RND2```). As for the `Mid` field; this information does not appear to be available yet for the 2021 data."

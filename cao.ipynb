    "The CAO points data, available from the [CAO website](http://www.cao.ie), is published in a different format for each of the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Each year's data, therefore, requires a different approach to acquisition, conversion to pandas dataframe, and cleaning. The 2019 data is published in two pdf files; one for level 8 courses, and one for levels 6 and 7. The 2020 data is published as an Excel spreadsheet, and the 2021 data as preformatted text in a HTML webpage.\n",
